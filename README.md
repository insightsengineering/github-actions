## Usage

To use this GitHub Action you will need to complete the following:

* Create a new file in your repository called `.github/workflows/r-license-report.yml`
* Copy the quickstart workflow from below into that new file, no extra configuration required
* Commit that file to a new branch
* Open up a pull request and observe the action working
* Review the output of the action as needed

### Quickstart

In your repository you should have a `.github/workflows/r-license-report.yml` folder with GitHub Action similar to below:

```yaml
---
name: License Report

on:
  push:
    branches-ignore: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  license-report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: License Report
        uses: insightsengineering/r-license-report@v1
```

### Complete example

The following workflow is a complete example that highlights the available options in this Action:

```yaml
---
name: License Compliance Check

on:
  push:
    branches-ignore: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  license-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Generate License Report
        uses: insightsengineering/r-license-report@v1
        with:
          # R package root path, in case your R package is within a subdirectory of the repo
          path: "."
          # A regular expression that can be used for matching and flagging non-compliant licenses
          regex: "^AGPL.*"
          # Fail the action if 1 or more matching non-compliant licenses are found
          fail: true
          # Select an RSPM snapshot date for CRAN dependency metadata retrieval
          rspm_snapshot_date: "2021-12-12"
          # Select a Bioconductor release version for BioC dependency metadata retrieval
          bioc_release: "3.14"
          # Whether you also want the report as an `html` file
          as_html: true

      - name: Upload PDF Report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
