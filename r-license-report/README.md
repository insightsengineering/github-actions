## How to use

To use this GitHub Action you will need to complete the following:

* Create a new file in your repository called `.github/workflows/r-license-report.yml`
* Copy the quickstart workflow from below into that new file, no extra configuration required
* Commit that file to a new branch
* Open up a pull request and observe the action working
* Review the output of the action as needed

### Quickstart

In your repository you should have a `.github/workflows/r-license-report.yml` folder with GitHub Action similar to below:

```yaml
---
name: License Report

on:
  push:
    branches-ignore: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  license-report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: License Report
        uses: insightsengineering/r-license-report@main
```

### Complete example

The following workflow is a complete example that highlights the available options in this Action:

```yaml
---
name: License Compliance Check

on:
  push:
    branches-ignore: [main]
  pull_request:

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: License Report
        uses: insightsengineering/r-license-report@main
        with:
          # R package root path, in case your R package is within a subdirectory of the repo
          path: "."
          # A regular expression that can be used for matching and flagging non-compliant licenses
          regex: "^GPL.*"
          # Fail the action if 1 or more matching non-compliant licenses are found
          fail: true
          # Select an MRAN snapshot date for CRAN dependency metadata retrieval
          mran_snapshot_date: "2021-06-28"
          # Select a Bioconductor release version for BioC dependency metadata retrieval
          bioc_release: "3.12"
```
